*If you are a commercial organisation / spin-off then please contact pjtoye@gmail.com or requests@vitalvideos.org for more information about the complete datasets totalling ~5000 participants*

First you must read and complete all required fields in the "DTA - Research.pdf" document.
It is very important to disclose the names of all people working on the project as well as the existence of previous/current ties to organisations working on similar technology.

Then you must either manually or digitally sign this document. Either is fine.

Send the completed and signed document to pjtoye@gmail.com (through your organisation e-mail) 
and propose a couple of short timeslots (20min) in the coming weeks that are compatible with 8:00am or 4:00-5:30pm Brussels time (Belgium, West-Europe).

Please also provide a link to your Google Scholar profile or your personal page on your university's website.

Before the meeting I will review your signed document and identity.
The meeting allows me to know who will be using the dataset and allows you to ask any questions you have concerning the dataset / license.
After the meeting I will send you the access credentials to the FTP server.
